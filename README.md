description :
Task 4 focuses on building a Generative Text Model that can produce coherent and meaningful paragraphs based on user prompts. This can be done using either a pretrained GPT model (such as GPT-2) for high-quality text generation or by training an LSTM network from scratch on a chosen dataset. The aim is to demonstrate how natural language processing (NLP) techniques enable machines to generate human-like text, and the deliverable is a Google Colab notebook showing the implementation, user prompt input, and generated text output.
When a user enters a topic/prompt (e.g., “Artificial Intelligence in Education”), the model should generate a coherent paragraph on that subject.

Example output (from GPT model):

“Artificial Intelligence in education is transforming the way students learn by providing personalized tutoring, adaptive assessments, and intelligent learning platforms. Teachers benefit from AI-powered tools that reduce workload and enable more focus on student engagement.”
